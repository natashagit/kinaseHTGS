# Solubility Prediction of Large Chameleonic Molecules

## About

This project aims to predict the solubility of large, chameleonic moleculesâ€”compounds that alter their shape, influencing their solubility. Understanding solubility is crucial in drug development, as it determines the administration route (oral ingestion vs. intravenous) and impacts dosage considerations that can affect other organs.

## Project Overview

Due to the scarcity of solubility data for large molecules, we trained a Random Forest Regressor using solubility data from small molecules. This model predicts the solubility of larger molecules by evaluating key properties:

- **Number of Rotational Bonds**
- **Hydrogen Bond Donors**
- **Molecular Weight**
- **Topological Polar Surface Area**

Each property is weighted according to its influence on solubility. The model classifies molecules into four solubility categories:

- Highly Soluble
- Soluble
- Low Solubility
- Insoluble

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Developed using Jinja templating with HTML and CSS.
- **Backend**: Built with Flask to handle API calls.
- **Molecular Property Calculation**: Utilized RDKit to compute molecular properties.
- **3D Molecular Visualization**: Employed PyMOL to generate 3D images of molecules.

## User Interaction

Users can input a molecule's name via a search bar. The application then displays:

- A 3D image of the molecule
- Calculated properties
- Predicted solubility level

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natashagit/kinaseHTGS.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:**:

# To install/update the project's dependencies
```sh
